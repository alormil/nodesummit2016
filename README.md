# GETTING STARTED WITH PARTICLE

## Connecting the particle

1. Go to: [Particle build site](https://build.particle.io/) and create and account.  Keep this page open once an account is created as we will be using it to do all of our development
2. Go to the [Particle.io docs](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/intro/photon/) and click on **SETUP MY PHOTON** and follow step 1
3. Navigate to [Connecting over USB](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/connect/photon/) and follow the instructions for your operating system.
4. Plug your Photon into your computer and make sure it is blinking blue. If it is node, hold down the "mode" button for 5 seconds until it blinks blue.
5. Run the command `particle setup`. A series of questions will pop up:
    - **Would you like to continue with this one?** Yes
    - **Found "Photon-****". Would you like to perform setup on this one now?** Yes
    - **Would you like to manually enter your Wi-Fi network configuration?** No
    - **Please select the network to which your Photon should connect:** //pick your network
    - **Please enter your network password:** //type the password
    - **Would you like to continue with the information shown above?**  Yes

Once connected, you should see a color change on the photon from flashing blue to breathing cyan.

## Hello World
